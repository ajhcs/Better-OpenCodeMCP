# First Steps

Once installed, here's how to get started with OpenCode MCP Tool.

## Test Connection

```
/opencode:ping "Hello from OpenCode!"
```

## Basic File Analysis

Analyze a single file:
```
/opencode:analyze @README.md summarize this
```

## Natural Language Usage

Just ask naturally:
- "Use opencode to explain this codebase"
- "Ask opencode to analyze the architecture"
- "Have opencode review this function"

## Sandbox Testing

Test code safely:
```
/opencode:sandbox create a Python script that generates fibonacci numbers
```
